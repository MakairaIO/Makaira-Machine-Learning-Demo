# Makaira Machine Learning Demo

See it in action: https://touchdemo.makaira.io/

## Requirements:
- NodeJS version 10+ installed

## Start developing
1. Clone repository
2. `cd server && npm install && npm run dev`
3. `cd client && npm install && npm run dev`

The Clientside-App is being served on `http://localhost:3000` and the server is served on `http://localhost:4000`.

Both URLs can be used to test the application but port 3000 also offers Live-Reloading if you change parts of the client-code.
